## Using the editable component

You should attach component to page and set components property the same as at RainLab.Blog.

First you must ensure that the Editable component is attached to the page or layout. Then create a content block using the CMS.

For a content block with the file **welcome.htm**, that would be located in the **/content** directory of a theme, it can be displayed on the front end like this:

```
<!-- This content will be editable -->
{% component 'editable_blog' %}
```

## Permissions

Only administrator with the permission *Manage content* are able to edit content. Administrators must also be logged in to the back-end.


## Front-end JavaScript and StyleSheet

The components in this plugin provide custom stylesheet and javascript files to function correctly on the front-end. Ensure that you have `{% scripts %}` and `{% styles %}` in your page or layout.

The styles also depend on the October JavaScript Framework, so ensure the `{% framework %}` tag is also included in your page or layout.
